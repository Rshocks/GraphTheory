# GraphTheory
All my work from Graph Theory module contained here, it contains the modules work from the weeks, set to public so one should be able to pull the jupyter notebook work
down off github.

Then its a case of pulling the repo into whichever file you choose, using command prompt or cmdr to cd to its location, then ensuring jupyter notebook in installed
correctly and then running it through cmdr or command promt by typing jupyter notebook
